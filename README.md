Google Maps Android API Sample: Current Place Details
=====================================================

I started the project using an Android Google Maps SDK sample that needs a Google Cloud API key and which allows you to see your real time location. 
After that I implemented an SQLite database to store interests added by users and display them.
Using the interests and the exact coordinates provided by methods included in the SDK I was able to created a "dumb" recommendation system
which opens a browser intent searching coordinates and a randomly picked interest of the user in order to find out information that the user might enjoy
about the place in immediate proximity. I am currently working on a smart recommender system which uses machine learning in order to create a much more cooler project.
