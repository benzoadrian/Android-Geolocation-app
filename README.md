Google Maps Android API Sample: Current Place Details
=====================================================

I started the project using an Android Google Maps SDK sample that needs a Google Cloud API key which allows you to see your real-time location. 
After that, I implemented an SQLite database to store interests added by users and display them.
Using the interests and the exact coordinates provided by methods included in the SDK I was able to create a "dumb" recommendation system
that opens a browser intent searching coordinates and a randomly picked interest of the user to find out information that the user might enjoy
about the place in immediate proximity. I am currently working on a smart recommender system that uses machine learning to create a much cooler project.
